  Tebako 0.8.7 introduces forward compatibility for Linux distributions that
  depend on the GNU C Library (`glibc`).
---

== Introduction

We are excited to announce significant enhancements in Tebako v0.8.7 that improve
package portability across different Linux distributions.

This update introduces forward compatibility for Linux distributions that depend
on the GNU C Library (`glibc`), offering greater flexibility in deploying your
packaged applications on a wider range of platforms.

== Package portability

=== What is portability?

In software development, portability refers to the ability of a software
application or package to run on different computing environments without
requiring significant modifications. This can include different operating
systems, hardware architectures, or versions of system libraries.

=== Tebako package portability

Package portability has always been a key focus for Tebako. Tebako packages are
designed to be "forward portable" across different operating systems and
architectures. This means that a package created on a specific platform can be
executed on a newer version of the same platform, allowing for easy distribution
and deployment.

Tebako now provides the following benefits relating to package portability:

* Broad compatibility: Packages created with Tebako v0.8.7 are now compatible
with a wider range of operating systems and Linux distributions.

* Forward portability: Packages can run on newer versions of the same platform
they were built on.

** For `glibc` systems, Tebako provides the `--patchelf` option which allows
packages built on glibc-based systems to run on Linux distributions with glibc
2.31 and above. For example, a Tebako executable package built on Ubuntu 20.04
with the `--patchelf` option can be executed on Rocky Linux 9.

** Packages built for the `musl` implementation of the C standard library (such
as Alpine Linux) are forward portable. For instance, a Tebako executable package
built on Alpine 3.17 can be executed on Alpine 3.19.

** macOS packages are forward portable across different macOS versions. For
example, a Tebako executable package built on macOS 12 (Monterey) can be
executed on macOS 14 (Sonoma), but not vice versa.

* Cross-architecture support: macOS packages built on `x86_64` can run on Apple
M (ARM, `aarch64`) systems.

== C standard libraries and package portability

Understanding C standard libraries is crucial for grasping the importance of
Tebako's improvements in package portability. Tebako virtualizes above the
system libraries layer, providing a consistent environment for your application
to run in. This approach ensures that your application runs smoothly across
different platforms, regardless of the system libraries installed on the target
system.

The C standard library is a critical component of the system libraries layer,
and different Linux distributions use different implementations and versions
of the C standard library. For example:

* Ubuntu and Fedora use the GNU C Library (`glibc`)
* Alpine Linux uses the musl C library (`musl`)

These differences can lead to compatibility issues when deploying applications
across different distributions. Tebako addresses these challenges by providing a
consistent runtime environment for your application, regardless of the
underlying system libraries.

=== The GNU C library

https://sourceware.org/glibc/[glibc] (GNU C Library) is the most widely-used
implementation of the C standard library for Linux systems. It provides core
functionality for C programs, including system calls, string manipulation,
mathematical computations, and more. glibc is developed as part of the GNU
Project and is the default C library for most Linux distributions.

Key characteristics of glibc:

* Extensive feature set
* Optimized for performance
* Complex codebase
* Uses symbol versioning for backward compatibility

=== The musl C library

https://musl.libc.org[musl] is an alternative implementation of the C standard
library, designed to be lightweight, fast, and simple. musl is commonly used in
embedded systems and distributions focused on minimalism, such as
https://alpinelinux.org[Alpine Linux].

Key characteristics of musl:

* Smaller codebase
* Emphasis on correctness and simplicity
* Static linking friendly
* Does not use symbol versioning

== glibc vs musl: Forward portability differences

=== General

The approach to forward portability differs significantly between glibc and
musl.

=== glibc forward portability

glibc uses a mechanism called symbol versioning to maintain backward
compatibility while allowing the library to evolve. Each symbol (function or
variable) in glibc is assigned a version, and multiple versions of the same
symbol can coexist within the library.

This approach has advantages and challenges:

* *Advantage*: Older binaries can run on systems with newer glibc versions only
when the older glibc exist, guaranteeing identical behavior for the binary.

* *Challenge*: Binaries compiled against a glibc version may not run on
systems without that particular glibc version.

When a program is compiled, it is linked against specific versions of glibc
symbols. If this program is then run on a system with a newer glibc version, it
may fail to load because the required symbol versions are not present.

Running a Tebako-built package on a system with a newer glibc version will
result in an error like this:

[source]
----
$ ./executable
./executable: /lib64/libpthread.so.0: version `glibc_PRIVATE' not found (required by ./executable)
----

Prior to version 0.8.7, Tebako-built packages need to be recompiled for systems
with newer glibc versions.

=== musl forward portability

musl takes a different approach to forward portability:

* Does not use symbol versioning
* Aims for a stable
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface[ABI (Application Binary Interface)]
* Focuses on simplicity and correctness

This approach results in:

* *Advantage*: Simpler forward portability, as binaries are less likely to
depend on specific symbol versions.

* *Challenge*: May require recompilation for optimal performance on newer
systems.

In summary, while glibc offers better backward compatibility, musl provides
simpler forward portability. Tebako's improvements address these differences to
enhance package portability across various Linux distributions.

== Using `--patchelf` for glibc forward portability

=== Background

Around 3 weeks ago, https://github.com/laurent-martin[Laurent Martin] requested
https://rockylinux.org[Rocky Linux] 9 support in
https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako/issues/190[Issue #190]. This request was a
catalyst for the development of the `--patchelf` option in Tebako.

=== The solution

Originally suggested by https://github.com/d4rky-pl[Micha≈Ç Matyas], it is
apparently possible to achieve forward compatibility on glibc-based systems by
stripping symbol version information.

Tebako 0.8.7 now provides the `--patchelf` option, which allows packages built
with "older" glibc (pre 3.24) to work on newer gnu-linux versions. This option
modifies symbol version information in the binary after compilation as described
in https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako/issues/196[Issue #196].

=== Benefits

Using `--patchelf` gives you:

* *Increased compatibility*: Binaries can run on systems with newer glibc
versions than the one they were compiled against.

* *No source code changes*: This solution works without requiring changes to the
original source code or recompilation.

* *Flexibility*: Developers can compile on newer systems while still targeting
older environments.

=== Usage

The `--patchelf` option can be applied when creating the Tebako package using
the `tebako press` command:

[source,bash]
----
tebako-build --patchelf ...other options...
----

This instructs Tebako to apply the necessary modifications to the resulting
binary for improved glibc compatibility.

== Caveats

Support for glibc forward portable packages is subject to the following caveats:

. The `--patchelf` option is currently experimental.

. The `--patchelf` option is only available for the GNU toolchain, not yet for
clang/llvm.

. The package is built against the installed OpenSSL version on the system
(e.g., 1.1.1), which needs to be present at the target system. If the target
system has a different version of OpenSSL, the package will not work.

== Support for glibc-dependent Linux distributions

The following table lists the versions of glibc Linux distributions supported
by Tebako packages through `--patchelf`:

|===
| Distribution | Minimal supported version | glibc version

| Ubuntu | 20.04 (Focal Fossa) | glibc 2.31
| Debian | 11 (Bullseye) | glibc 2.31
| Rocky Linux | 9 | glibc 2.34
| Fedora | 33 | glibc 2.32
| CentOS | 9 | glibc 2.34
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) | 9 | glibc 2.34

latest information on supported distributions and versions.

Usage of the
https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako-ci-containers[Tebako Docker containers] for
packaging is encouraged since it eliminates the effort needed for toolchain
setup and configuration.

== Best practices for forward compatibility

To ensure the best forward compatibility for your Tebako packages, consider the
following best practices:

**Define the target environments**: Identify the target OSes, architectures,
Linux distributions and versions that your application will run on. This
helps you determine the compatibility requirements for your Tebako packages.

**For glibc systems, use the `--patchelf` option**: When building packages
for glibc-based systems, apply the `--patchelf` option to improve
compatibility with newer glibc versions.

**Test on target systems**: Verify that your Tebako packages run correctly on
the target systems before deployment. This helps identify any compatibility
issues early on.

== Conclusion

Tebako 0.8.7 introduces significant improvements in package portability,
particularly for Linux systems depending on glibc and musl. The new `--patchelf`
option allows for greater flexibility in deployments, enabling packages created
on Ubuntu 20 to run seamlessly on Linux GNU distributions with glibc version
2.31 and above.

These enhancements have been rigorously tested across multiple distributions,
including Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, Fedora, and CentOS, ensuring reliability and
performance. They reinforce Tebako's core benefits of simplified deployment,
enhanced security, and consistent application performance across diverse
environments.
