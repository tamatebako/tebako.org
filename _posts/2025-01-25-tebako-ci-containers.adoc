  Tebako now offers Linux GNU and musl containers on amd64 and arm64
  architectures with preinstalled Tebako environments.
---

Tebako aims to simplify the packaging process for developers across platforms
and architectures, and we understand that a pre-packaged environment can
significantly reduce the complexity of the packaging process.

We're excited to announce the launch of
https://github.com/orgs/tamatebako/packages?repo_name=tebako-ci-containers[*Tebako Packaging Containers*],
now available on the
*GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)*.

These containers streamline workflows and ensure compatibility with both
*GNU Linux* and *musl-based distributions*.

== Introducing Tebako packaging containers

Creating Tebako packages for Linux requires matching the target system's architecture and standard library implementation. For instance:
- **x86_64/aarch64 packages** must be built on **x86_64/aarch64 systems**, respectively.
- Packages for **GNU/musl Linux** must be created in corresponding **GNU/musl environments**.

Installing Tebako on diverse Linux configurations can be challenging, and our testing focuses on specific Ubuntu and Alpine setups.
To overcome these challenges, we provide **Docker containers** preconfigured with the Tebako executable packager.

=== Key Benefits

* *Cross-Distribution Compatibility*: Package applications for Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora, Alpine, and more.
* *Multiarchitecture Ready*: Build for both `amd64` and `arm64` platforms effortlessly.
* *Reliable and Tested*: Our containers are rigorously tested to ensure high performance and reliability.
* *Community-Driven*: Your feedback matters! Share your experiences to help us improve Tebako containers.

== Available containers

=== General

We offer containers designed for packaging in **GNU** and **musl** target environments.

The Tebako packaging containers are available in both **x86_64** (`amd64`) and
**`aarch64`** / **`arm64`** architectures.

They include multi-architecture manifests and come preconfigured with Tebako
packaging environments for Ruby versions **3.2.6** and **3.3.6**.

To run the container, use the following command:

[example]
====
.Running a Tebako container interactively with `bash`
[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/mnt/w ghcr.io/tamatebako/tebako-<container_tag>:latest bash
----
====

The currently available tags are described below.

=== `ubuntu-20.04`

The
https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako-ci-containers/pkgs/container/tebako-ubuntu-20.04[Tebako `ubuntu-20.04` container]
is based on https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/[**Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**], providing
a suitable environment for packaging applications targeting **GNU systems** with
the https://sourceware.org/glibc[`glibc` implementation of the C standard library].

NOTE: Don't let the Ubuntu version fool you! While this container version is
based on Ubuntu 20.04, packages built using the container are compatible with
all other Ubuntu distributions newer than Ubuntu 20.04.

This container builds packages compatible with the following platforms:

.Minimum GLIBC Versions for Tebako Packages
[cols="3", options="header"]
|===
| Distribution | Minimum Supported Version | GLIBC Version
| Ubuntu | 20.04 (Focal Fossa) | GLIBC 2.31
| Debian | 11 (Bullseye) | GLIBC 2.31
| Rocky Linux | 9 | GLIBC 2.34
| Fedora | 33 | GLIBC 2.32
| CentOS | 9 | GLIBC 2.34
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) | 9 | GLIBC 2.34
| Oracle Linux | 9 | GLIBC 2.34
|===

NOTE: Compatibility with these distributions is based on the minimum supported
GLIBC version, through the Tebako `--patchelf` option which ensures forward
compatibility with GNU Linux distributions using GLIBC version 2.31 and above.

To use the container, run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/mnt/w ghcr.io/tamatebako/tebako-ubuntu-20.04:latest bash
----


=== `alpine-3.17`

The
https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako-ci-containers/pkgs/container/tebako-alpine-3.17[Tebako `alpine-3.17` container]
is based on https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/[**Alpine Linux 3.17**], offering
an optimized environment for packaging applications targeting systems with the
https://musl.libc.org[`musl` implementation of the C standard library].

NOTE: While this container version is based on Alpine 3.17, packages built using
the container are compatible with all other Alpine distributions newer than
Alpine 3.17.


== Using the Tebako containers

=== General

There are two primary methods for packaging with Tebako:

**From outside the container**::
Using Docker commands to package your application without entering the container.

**From inside the container**::
Interactively working within the container to package your application.

=== Prerequisites

* Docker installed on your machine.
* A Ruby application ready for packaging.

=== From outside the container

You can package your application from outside the container by running a single
Docker command. This command mounts your workspace into the container and
executes the `tebako press` command.

The following `press` command parameters are to be specified:

* Application root (`--root=[application_root_directory]`)
* Entry point (`--entry-point=[entry_point]`)
* Output location (`--output=[output_executable]`)
* Ruby version (`--Ruby=[version]`)

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -v <application_folder>:/mnt/w \
  -t ghcr.io/tamatebako/tebako-${{ container_tag }}:latest \
  tebako press <tebako press parameters>
----

.Packaging the `fontist` gem from outside the container
[example]
====
To package the https://github.com/fontist/fontist[`fontist` gem], a Ruby
application for managing fonts, located in the `fontist/` directory under the
current working directory, use the following command:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v $PWD:/mnt/w \
  -t ghcr.io/tamatebako/tebako-ubuntu-20.04:latest \
  tebako press --root=/mnt/w/fontist --entry-point=fontist --output=/mnt/w/fontist-package --Ruby=3.3.7
----
====

=== from inside the container

To package your application from inside the Tebako container, follow these
steps:

. Pull the Tebako container image:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ docker pull ghcr.io/tamatebako/tebako-<container_tag>:latest
----
+
Replace `<container_tag>` with the desired container tag (e.g., `ubuntu-20.04` or `alpine-3.17`).

. Start and enter the container interactively:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -it --rm -v <application_folder>:/mnt/w ghcr.io/tamatebako/tebako-<container_tag>:latest bash
----
+
Replace `<container_tag>` with the appropriate tag and `<application_folder>` with the path to your application folder.

. Once inside the container, run the `tebako press` command:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ tebako press <tebako press parameters>
----

.Packaging the `fontist` gem from inside the container
[example]
====
To package the https://github.com/fontist/fontist[`fontist` gem], located in
the `fontist/` directory under the current working directory, use the following
commands:

[source,sh]
----
# Start and enter the container
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/mnt/w ghcr.io/tamatebako/tebako-<container_tag>:latest bash

# Run this after entering the container
$ tebako press --root=/mnt/w/fontist --entry-point=fontist --output=/mnt/w/fontist-package --Ruby=3.3.7
----
====

If you are packaging a Ruby Gem, the `*.gemspec` file is used to specify files
included in the gem, often using the shell command `git ls-files`. This means that when
packaging from inside the container, the container's instance of `git` will be
used to resolve these files.

If you use a mounted host directory for packaging, the container's instance of
`git` will be used to obtain this list by default, and if the packaging directory
is not a Git repository, the command will fail.

To resolve this, you shall alter the container's configuration by running the
following command before packaging:

[source,sh]
----
git config --global --add safe.directory <source>
----

NOTE: Thanks to https://github.com/bradgessler[bradgessler] for the suggestion!

Packaging from inside the container is primarily designed to support CI
environments like GitHub Actions (GHA) or Cirrus CI. It provides a complete
packaging environment that does not require any additional installations, making
it ideal for automated workflows.

=== Samples
