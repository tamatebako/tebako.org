= Introducing Tebako Packaging Containers: Multiarchitecture Support for GNU and musl Linux

At Tebako, we're simplifying the packaging process for developers across platforms and architectures.
We're thrilled to introduce our *Tebako Packaging Containers*, now available at *ghrc.io* (GitHub Container Registry).
These containers streamline your workflow while ensuring compatibility with both *GNU Linux* and *musl-based distributions*.

== Multiarchitecture Support: amd64 and arm64

Supporting multiple architectures is no longer optional—it’s essential. Our Tebako Packaging Containers include *multiarchitecture manifests*
for both *amd64* and *arm64*, ensuring seamless compatibility on traditional x86_64 systems and modern ARM-based devices.

== Broad Distribution Support for GNU and musl Linux

Tebako Packaging Containers are built to support a wide range of Linux distributions, no matter the underlying libc implementation:

* *GNU Linux*: Built on *Ubuntu*, our container is also fully capable of packaging applications for *Red Hat* and *Fedora*.
Rigorous testing ensures compatibility across these popular distributions, letting you focus on building great software.
* *musl-based distributions*: Built on *Alpine Linux*, our musl container works seamlessly with Alpine and other musl environments.
Have experience using our container with another musl-based distribution? Share your feedback to help us expand our support!

== Why Choose Tebako Packaging Containers?

* *Cross-Distribution Compatibility*: Package your applications for Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora, Alpine, and beyond.
* *Multiarchitecture Ready*: Package for both amd64 and arm64 platforms with ease.
* *Reliable and Tested*: Our containers undergo rigorous testing to ensure performance and reliability.
