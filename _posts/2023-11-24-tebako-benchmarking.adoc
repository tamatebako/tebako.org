= Benchmarking of tebako package against original Ruby applications

== Introduction

Performance is a critical consideration when packaging applications for
distribution. Tebako, as an executable packager, introduces several
architectural elements that could potentially impact performance. This article
presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis comparing Tebako-packaged
applications against their original Ruby implementations.

Tebako packages introduce four specific features that might affect performance:

. An additional filesystem access layer that routes calls either to the original
implementation or to the DwarFS in-memory packaged filesystem

. Resource consumption for decompression when accessing files from the DwarFS
filesystem

. Extraction of native extension shared libraries to temporary folders before loading

. Inclusion of the entire Ruby standard library and all files used during
installation, potentially increasing startup time

To quantify these potential impacts, we conducted systematic benchmarking across
various application types and usage patterns.

== Understanding key components

=== Tebako packaging

Tebako is an executable packager that combines a Ruby application and its
dependencies into a single executable binary. It allows users to run the
packaged software as if it were using a mounted filesystem, eliminating the need
for separate installation steps.

As described in our earlier
link:/blog/2023-02-24-tebako-technology-data-flow/[technology post],
Tebako packages a patched, statically linked Ruby interpreter with an embedded
DwarFS filesystem containing the application code and dependencies. This
approach provides excellent portability but introduces architectural elements
that could potentially impact performance.

The performance implications of this packaging approach vary based on the
application's characteristics, particularly its dependency on filesystem
operations and native extensions.

=== DwarFS filesystem

https://github.com/mhx/dwarfs[DwarFS] is a highly compressed, read-only
filesystem that serves as the foundation for Tebako's packaging strategy. It
enables efficient storage of Ruby applications and their dependencies within a
single executable.

DwarFS offers several advantages for application packaging:

* High compression ratios for efficient storage
* Fast read access for optimal performance
* Read-only nature that ensures package integrity

From a performance perspective, DwarFS introduces a trade-off: while
decompression requires computational resources, reading from an in-memory
filesystem can be faster than accessing files from disk, particularly for
mechanical hard drives.

== Benchmark targets

To comprehensively evaluate performance across different usage patterns, we
selected four distinct benchmark targets that represent a range of complexity
and resource usage patterns.

=== "Hello World" script

The "Hello World" script serves as our baseline test, focusing on core Ruby
interpreter performance with minimal external dependencies.

Purpose:: This simple script helps isolate the performance of Ruby's core
functionality, particularly the parsing and execution of basic Ruby code.

Implementation:: The script outputs a configurable number of "Hello, world"
messages and displays the gem path, with execution count controlled via
command-line arguments.

Value:: By minimizing external factors, this benchmark provides clear insights
into the baseline performance differences between native Ruby and
Tebako-packaged applications.

[source,ruby]
----
if (argv = ARGV).empty?
  puts "No arguments given"
  exit(1)
end

if argv[0].to_i < 1
  puts "Argument must be a positive integer"
  exit(1)
end

argv[0].to_i.times do |i|
  puts "Hello, world number #{i}!"
  puts "Gem path: #{Gem.path}"
end
----

=== Coradoc

https://github.com/metanorma/coradoc[Coradoc] is a document markup processor
designed for structured content handling.

Purpose:: This benchmark tests file processing performance, particularly how
Tebako handles external file access and processing through pure Ruby code.

Features tested:: The benchmark exercises Coradoc's document parsing,
transformation, and OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language)
conversion capabilities.

Real-world relevance:: Document processing represents a common use case for Ruby
applications, making this benchmark relevant for assessing performance in
content management and documentation systems.

[source,ruby]
----
if (argv = ARGV).empty?
  puts "No arguments given"
  exit(1)
end

if argv[0].to_i < 1
  puts "Argument must be a positive integer"
  exit(1)
end

argv[0].to_i.times do
  require "coradoc"
  sample_file = File.join(__dir__, "fixtures", "sample.adoc")
  require "coradoc/legacy_parser"
  Coradoc::LegacyParser.parse(sample_file)[:document]

  require "coradoc/oscal"
  sample_file = File.join(__dir__, "fixtures", "sample-oscal.adoc")
  document = Coradoc::Document.from_adoc(sample_file)
  Coradoc::Oscal.to_oscal(document)

  syntax_tree = Coradoc::Parser.parse(sample_file)
  Coradoc::Transformer.transform(syntax_tree)
end
----

=== Vectory

https://rubygems.org/gems/vectory[Vectory] is a vector graphics processing
library that includes native extensions for performance-critical operations.

Purpose:: This benchmark evaluates how Tebako handles applications with native
extensions, particularly focusing on the performance impact of extracting and
loading these extensions from temporary locations.

Features tested:: The benchmark exercises Vectory's EMF to SVG conversion
capabilities, which rely on native extensions for efficient processing.

Real-world relevance:: Many production Ruby applications leverage native
extensions for performance-critical operations, making this benchmark essential
for understanding Tebako's impact on such applications.

[source,ruby]
----
require "tempfile"

if (argv = ARGV).empty?
  puts "No arguments given"
  exit(1)
end

if argv[0].to_i < 1
  puts "Argument must be a positive integer"
  exit(1)
end

argv[0].to_i.times do
  require "emf2svg"

  svg = Emf2svg.from_file(File.join(__dir__, "fixtures", "img.emf"))

  Tempfile.create(["output", ".svg"]) do |tempfile|
    tempfile.write(svg)
    puts "SVG written to #{tempfile.path}"
  end
end
----

=== Metanorma

https://www.metanorma.org[Metanorma] is a comprehensive standards document
authoring and publishing suite that combines numerous Ruby gems, native
extensions, and Java components.

Purpose:: This benchmark tests complex application performance, representing the
most comprehensive real-world scenario in our test suite.

Features tested:: The benchmark exercises various Metanorma commands, including
help, version, and site generation for different standards formats (IETF, IEEE,
IEC, ISO, IHO).

Real-world relevance:: As an enterprise-level document processing system,
Metanorma represents the kind of complex application that benefits most from
packaging solutions like Tebako, making it an ideal test case for real-world
performance assessment.

The Metanorma benchmark included execution of utility commands (`metanorma
help`, `metanorma version`) and generation of sample sites for various standards
formats using:

[source,sh]
----
$ metanorma site generate samples -c samples/metanorma.yml -o site-<site name> --agree-to-terms
----

== Testing methodology

Our benchmarking approach focused on comparing execution times between native
Ruby applications and their Tebako-packaged equivalents across various
workloads.

=== Environment specifications

All tests were conducted on the following hardware and software configuration:

----
Model Name: Mac mini
Model Identifier: Macmini9,1
Chip: Apple M1
Total Number of Cores: 8 (4 performance and 4 efficiency)
Memory: 16 GB
Ruby 3.1.4p223 (2023-03-30 revision 957bb7cb81) [arm64-darwin21]
Tebako executable packager 0.5.5
----

=== Test procedures

For the Hello World, Coradoc, and Vectory benchmarks, we executed multiple runs
with varying repetition counts to assess how performance differences scale with
workload. This approach helps distinguish between fixed overhead (such as
initialization time) and proportional overhead (such as ongoing filesystem
access).

For the Metanorma benchmark, we executed various commands that generate
different load profiles, providing insights into performance across diverse
usage patterns.

== Performance analysis

Our benchmarking results revealed several interesting patterns across the
different test cases.

=== Parsing performance

Surprisingly, Tebako-packaged applications parsed Ruby code faster than the
native interpreter in many cases. The combination of the filesystem access layer
routing and DwarFS decompression proved more efficient than reading from disk,
even when using an SSD.

This performance advantage was particularly evident in the Hello World
benchmark, where the Tebako package consistently outperformed the native Ruby
interpreter for code parsing and execution.

=== File processing performance

External file processing showed minimal performance differences between Tebako
packages and native applications, despite the additional filesystem access layer
introduced by Tebako.

The Coradoc benchmark, which focuses on document processing through pure Ruby
code, demonstrated that Tebako's filesystem routing has negligible impact on
file processing performance.

=== Native extension handling

Applications with native extensions showed the most significant performance
differences, primarily during initialization. The Vectory benchmark highlighted
the additional time required to extract native extensions to temporary locations
before loading.

However, once initialized, the ongoing performance impact was minimal,
suggesting that the primary overhead is concentrated in the startup phase rather
than during normal operation.

=== Complex application performance

The Metanorma benchmark provided the most comprehensive view of real-world
performance implications. As expected, Tebako packages showed longer
initialization times due to the combined effects of loading the entire Ruby
standard library and extracting multiple native extensions.

However, the relative performance impact decreased as the workload increased,
indicating that the initialization overhead becomes less significant for
longer-running tasks.

== Key findings

Our benchmarking analysis revealed several key insights about Tebako's
performance characteristics:

. *Faster code parsing*: Tebako packages parse Ruby code faster than native
interpreters. The combination of the filesystem access layer and DwarFS
decompression outperforms direct disk access, even with SSDs.

. *Minimal file processing impact*: External file processing shows negligible
performance differences despite Tebako's additional filesystem access layer.

. *Initialization overhead*: Tebako packages incur a "penalty" during
initialization, primarily due to:

** Loading the Ruby standard library (which may not be fully utilized by the
application)

** Mapping the package to the application's memory address space

** Extracting and loading native extensions from temporary locations

. *Workload-dependent impact*: The performance impact decreases as workload
increases, making Tebako particularly suitable for longer-running applications
where initialization overhead becomes less significant.

== Conclusions and recommendations

Tebako packaging introduces a fixed initialization overhead that varies based on
application size and the presence of native extensions. In our tests, this
additional time ranged from 0.03 seconds for the "Hello, World" script to
approximately 3 seconds for the complex Metanorma application.

Importantly, this overhead:

* Is primarily concentrated during initialization
* Does not scale with data processing complexity
* Becomes less significant for longer-running tasks

Based on these findings, we can provide several recommendations for optimal
performance with Tebako-packaged applications:

. *Ideal use cases*: Tebako is particularly well-suited for applications where:

** Distribution simplicity outweighs minor initialization delays

** Tasks run long enough to amortize the initialization overhead

** Simplified deployment provides significant operational benefits

. *Performance optimization*: When packaging performance-critical applications:

** Consider the initialization overhead in your application's startup sequence

** For applications with frequent short runs, evaluate whether the packaging
benefits outweigh the cumulative initialization overhead

. *User experience*: For interactive applications:

** Consider implementing splash screens or progress indicators during
initialization

** Defer non-essential module loading to minimize initial startup time

Overall, our benchmarking demonstrates that Tebako provides an excellent balance
between distribution simplicity and performance, with minimal impact on runtime
performance for most real-world applications.
