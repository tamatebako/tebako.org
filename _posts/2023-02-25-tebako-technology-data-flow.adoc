= Tebako technology and data flow

== General

Tebako is an executable packager. It packages a set of files into a single
executable binary that allows a user to run a selected file from the packaged
software as if it is a mounted filesystem.

Tebako is capable of packaging Ruby applications for Linux
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/[glibc] the GNU C Library, and
https://www.musl-libc.org[musl libc]),
macOS, and Windows (MSys) platforms.

NOTE: Tebako 0.4.0 provides limited Windows support. It can only package
dependency gems without native extensions.

The package created by Tebako is a patched, statically linked Ruby interpreter
with embedded https://github.com/mhx/dwarfs[DwarFS] -- a fast high-compression
read-only filesystem. The embedded filesystem contains application source code,
including pre-built native extensions and other gem dependencies.

Tebako's Ruby patches reroute IO calls to the DwarFS access library --
https://github.com/tamatebako/libdwarfs[libdwarfs].

This library is an integral part of the Tebako project that implements a direct
DwarFS access layer, thus eliminating a need for fuse drivers or any other
additional support from the operating system.


== Tebako packaging data flow

Building the Tebako package is a complex procedure that consists of 6 steps, as
shown in the flowchart below.

Recurring packaging runs allow the reuse of some artifacts, but it is not
described here for simplicity.


== Packaging data flow description

=== Build 1

Build Ruby with a static Ruby library and static extensions ("target Ruby").

In terms of Ruby configuration, this build implies two options:

[source]
----
--with-static-linked-ext
--disable-shared
----

It is worth mentioning that this configuration requires some minor patching of
the Ruby source to compile without errors.

=== Install

Install the solution to be packaged into a pristine environment ("source
filesystem").

Depending on the configuration files in the project folder, the Tebako packager
supports several scenarios with different installation procedures.

[cols="a,a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
|Scenario | `*.gemspec`| `Gemfile`| `*.gem`

| 1| No| No| No
| 2| No| No| One
| 3| One| No| Any
| 4| One| One| Any
| 5| No| One| Any
| Error| No| No| Two or more
| Error| Two or more| Any| Any

|===

Of course, the real value comes with scenario 5, but the table below describes
other options for completeness.

[cols="a,a,3a",options="header"]
|===
| Scenario| Description| Installation procedure

| 1
| Simple Ruby script
|
* Copy project root with all sub-folders

| 2
| Packaged gem
|
* Install the gem with `gem install`

| 3
| Gem source
|
* Build the gem using `gem build` command
* Install it with `gem install`

| 4
| Bundled gem source
|
* Collect dependencies with `bundle install`
* Build the gem using `gem build` command.
* Install it with `gem install`

| 5
| Bundled solution
|
* Install solution with `bundle install`

|===

=== Package

Create highly compressed, read-only file systems in the DwarFS format ("packaged
filesystem") from the directory structure built on the previous step.

This step is performed using the
https://github.com/mhx/dwarfs/blob/main/doc/mkdwarfs.md[mkdwarfs] utility or its
https://github.com/tamatebako/dwarfs[ports] to other operating systems developed
as a part of the Tebako project.

=== Embed

Encode DwarFS filesystem image into a C++ source file using
https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin[INCBIN macro].


=== Patch

Patch the target Ruby source to redefine calls to IO functions to calls to
the DwarFS access layer.

The packager injects simple preprocessor statements like:

[source,c]
----
#define read(...)   tebako_read(__VA_ARGS__)
----

Where `tebako_read` is a function implemented by the
https://github.com/tamatebako/libdwarfs[libdwarfs] library.

The library routes the call either to:

* the host (calls read); or
* serves it from the DwarFS image.

=== Build 2

In the last step, the patched Ruby source is compiled and linked with the
embedded DwarFS filesystem and libdwarfs. The output binary is the target Tebako
package -- a single executable binary that runs the embedded image.
