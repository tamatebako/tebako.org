= Announcing Tebako v0.11.0: Decoupling Runtime and Application

We are excited to announce the release of Tebako v0.11.0, introducing a groundbreaking feature
that allows the separate packaging of the runtime environment and application. This advancement
enables developers to create a reusable Ruby execution environment, facilitating the deployment
of multiple applications or different versions of the same application with greater efficiency
and flexibility.

== Decoupling Runtime and Application

In previous versions, Tebako packaged the Ruby interpreter, dependencies, and the application
into a single executable. While effective, this approach required repackaging the entire stack
for each application or version update. With v0.11.0, we have decoupled the runtime from the application,
allowing the creation of a standalone runtime package that can be reused across various applications.

== Benefits of the New Feature

- *Enhanced Flexibility*: Developers can now maintain a consistent runtime environment across multiple
applications, ensuring compatibility and reducing the need for redundant packaging.
- *Improved Efficiency*: By reusing the runtime package, the time and resources required for packaging
and deployment are significantly reduced.
- *Simplified Updates*: Updating the runtime environment no longer necessitates repackaging each application
individually, streamlining maintenance processes.

== Packaging Modes and Workflow

Tebako v0.11.0 supports several packaging modes to suit different deployment scenarios:

- *"bundle"*: Package runtime and application into a single file (as implemented originally).
- *"runtime"*: Create a runtime executable that can be used to run different applications
or different versions of the same application.
- *"application"*: Package the application separately, designed to be executed by the runtime.
- *"both"*: Create runtime and application as two separate entities.

Here’s how these modes fit into your workflow:

1. *Create the Runtime Package*: Use the `tebako create-runtime` command to package the Ruby interpreter
and dependencies into a standalone runtime executable.
2. *Package Your Application*: Utilize the `tebako package-app` command to package your application code,
specifying the path to the previously created runtime package.
3. *Deploy and Execute*: Deploy both the runtime and application packages to your target environment.
Execute your application by referencing the runtime package, ensuring a consistent and reusable execution environment.

This flexibility allows developers to tailor their deployment strategy to their specific needs while reducing redundant effort.

== Conclusion

The release of Tebako v0.11.0 marks a significant milestone in our mission to provide innovative solutions
for Ruby application deployment. By enabling the separate packaging of runtime and application, we empower
developers with greater flexibility, efficiency, and control over their deployment processes.
We encourage you to explore this new feature and share your feedback with us. Your insights are invaluable
as we continue to enhance Tebako to better serve the developer community.
