= Announcing Tebako v0.11.0: decoupling runtime and application

We are excited to announce the release of Tebako v0.11.0, introducing a
groundbreaking feature that allows the separate packaging of the runtime
environment and application.

This advancement enables developers to create a reusable Ruby execution
environment, facilitating the deployment of multiple applications or different
versions of the same application with greater efficiency and flexibility.

== Decoupling runtime and application

In previous versions, Tebako packaged all these components into a single
executable:

* Ruby interpreter
* Ruby dependencies
* the application code and resources

While effective, this approach required repackaging the entire stack for each
application or version update.

With v0.11.0, we have decoupled the runtime from the application, allowing the
creation of a standalone runtime package that can be reused across various
applications.

== Benefits of the new feature

=== Enhanced flexibility

Tebako v0.11.0's decoupled architecture introduces a new level of flexibility in
deployment scenarios. By maintaining a consistent runtime environment across
multiple applications, organizations can ensure standardization and
compatibility throughout their Ruby application ecosystem.

This separation allows developers to deploy different applications or versions
while maintaining the same underlying Ruby environment, significantly reducing
complexity in managing multiple deployments.

=== Improved efficiency

The new architecture brings substantial improvements in resource utilization and
deployment speed. Instead of packaging the entire Ruby runtime with each
application, developers can now reuse a single runtime package across multiple
applications.

This approach significantly reduces:

* Storage requirements for deployed applications
* Time spent packaging applications
* Network bandwidth needed for distribution
* System resource usage during deployment

=== Simplified updates and maintenance

One of the most significant advantages of the decoupled architecture is the
streamlined update process.

When updates to the Ruby runtime or its dependencies are required, developers
can now:

* Update the runtime package once
* Deploy the updated runtime across all applications
* Avoid the need to repackage individual applications

This approach dramatically reduces maintenance overhead and ensures consistent
runtime environments across all deployments.

== Deployment options

=== Packaging modes

Tebako v0.11.0 introduces flexible packaging modes to accommodate various
deployment scenarios:

* Bundle mode
* Runtime mode
* Application mode
* "Both" mode

=== Bundle mode

The traditional single-file packaging mode, combining both runtime and
application in a single executable.

If you want to distribute a single, simple executable without any local or
remote dependencies, this is the mode for you.

Characteristics:

* Ideal for standalone deployments.
* Ensures complete portability.
* Maintains backwards compatibility.

NOTE: This is the default Tebako pre-v0.11.0 behavior.

=== Runtime mode

In this mode, Tebako creates a separate runtime package containing the Ruby
interpreter and its dependencies. This runtime package can be shared across
multiple applications.

Characteristics:

* Reduces overall deployment size of the application.
* Simplifies runtime updates.
* Enhances application portability.

=== Application mode

In this mode, Tebako packages only the application code and resources, relying
on a shared runtime package for execution.

Characteristics:

* Requires a compatible runtime package built using runtime mode.
* Enables quick application updates.
* Reduces package size.

=== Both mode

Creates separate runtime and application packages in one go.

Characteristics:

* Provides maximum flexibility.
* Enables independent updates.
* Ideal for complex deployment scenarios.

== Building Tebako packages

To leverage these new features, follow this streamlined process.

Given a Ruby application at `hello.rb`:

[source,Ruby]
----
puts "Hello, #{ARGV[0]}!"
----

. *Create the runtime package*:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ tebako press -m runtime -o tebako-runtime-package [-R {ruby-ver}]
----

. *Create the application package*:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ tebako press -m application -o tebako-application-package -e hello.rb -r test
----

. *Run the application*: using the pre-packaged runtime.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ tebako-runtime-package --tebako-run tebako-application-package Maxim
----
+
Which outputs:
+
[source]
----
Hello, Maxim!
----

. *Deploy the packages*

** Deploy the runtime package to a shared location for download

** Distribute application packages as needed

** Execute applications using the shared runtime

This flexibility allows developers to tailor their deployment strategy to their
specific needs while reducing redundant effort.

== Conclusion

The release of Tebako v0.11.0 marks a significant milestone in our mission to
provide innovative solutions for Ruby application deployment.

By enabling the separate packaging of runtime and application, we empower
developers with greater flexibility, efficiency, and control over their
deployment processes.
