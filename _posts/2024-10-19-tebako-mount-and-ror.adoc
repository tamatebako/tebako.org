== Tebako 0.9.0 provides Rails support through host folder mounting

We are delighted to announce the release of Tebako 0.9.0, a major update that
allows packaging of Ruby on Rails applications.

The highlight of this version is the introduction of **host folder mounting** to
Tebako's in-memory filesystem (memfs).

This capability effectively addresses one of the long-standing challenges of
packaging Rails applications due to the framework's reliance on hardcoded paths
for temporary files, caches, and sockets.


== Host folder mounting

Host folder mounting (HFM) is a feature that allows directories from the host
system (the machine running the Tebako-packaged application) to be made
accessible within the application's packaged filesystem.

Applications often need to read from or write to specific directories that are
outside the packaged application's filesystem for performance, security, or
persistence reasons.

On Unix-like systems, `/tmp` is a common directory for storing temporary files,
and `/var/log` is often used for log files. These directories are typically
writable by the system and are shared across applications.

Tebako's host folder mounting provides the ability to bridge these external
directories with the packaged application's filesystem, enabling seamless access
from the packaged application to these directories at runtime.

In effect, it allows the packaged application to read from and write to these
mounted directories as if they were part of its own filesystem, even though the
application is running from a packaged executable.

The following diagram illustrates the host folder mounting architecture.

== Comparing to Docker's bind mount

Host folder mounting in Tebako addresses the same use cases as Docker's bind
mount feature does.

Both mechanisms allow directories from the host system to be made accessible
within the application's runtime environment. This approach provides a way to
bridge the gap between the host filesystem and the application's filesystem,
enabling seamless access to necessary directories.

* In Docker, bind mounts are used to mount a directory from the host machine into
a container, allowing the container to read from and write to the host
directory.

* In Tebako, host folder mounting allows the packaged application to interact with
directories on the host system as if they were part of its own filesystem.

While the concept of mounting host directories is similar, there are key
differences between Tebako's host folder mounting and Docker's bind mount.

The key differences include:

* Packaged applications in Tebako run from a read-only filesystem (memfs). While
  applications in Docker containers are run from a read-write filesystem by
  default.

* Tebako packaged applications have full access to the host filesystem (outside
  of memfs) at runtime, while Docker containers are isolated from the host
  filesystem by default.


== Ruby on Rails on Tebako (RoRoT)

=== Introduction to Rails

Ruby on Rails, or as Rails or RoR, is a popular server-side web application
framework written in Ruby. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC)
architectural pattern and emphasizes convention over configuration. Rails is
known for its ability to accelerate web application development by providing
default structures for databases, web services, and web pages.

=== Why package with Tebako

With Tebako 0.9.0, you can now package and deploy Ruby on Rails applications
using Tebako.

There are multiple ways to deploy Rails applications, including traditional
server setups, containerized environments, and cloud platforms. However, these
methods often require additional setup and configuration, making deployment
complex and time-consuming.

Tebako simplifies the deployment process by packaging the entire Rails
application, including dependencies, into a single executable. This approach
provides a self-contained deployment package that can be run on various operating
systems without additional setup.

A packaged Rails application on Tebako can be called Ruby on Rails on Tebako
(RoRoT). RoRoT offers several benefits, including:

. Simplified deployment: RoRoT packages the entire Rails application, including
  dependencies, into a single executable.
. Enhanced security: By bundling everything into a self-contained executable,
  RoRoT helps protect code from unauthorized modifications.
. Improved portability: RoRoT creates packages that can run on various
  operating systems without additional setup.

=== Challenges with RoRoT

RoRoT differs from packaging normal Ruby gems or applications because of Rails'
complex structure and its expectations about the filesystem. Unlike simpler
Sinatra applications on Tebako, Rails applications require more sophisticated
handling of file paths and runtime directories.

The main challenge in using Rails with Tebako has been Rails' reliance on
specific filesystem structures, particularly for temporary files and caches.

By default, Rails places temporary files, caches, and sockets in hardcoded
directories within the application's root folder.

These directories often end up included in Tebako's read-only memfs, making
it difficult to support dynamic file writes during runtime. While some patches
have been suggested in the Rails community to allow configuration of these
paths, the core issue remains unresolved.

Tebako 0.9.0 addresses this challenge with its new host folder mounting feature,
which mounts host directories to the memfs tree, offering a seamless workaround
for these Rails limitations. This feature allows you to overlay writable host
directories onto your packaged Rails application without modifying the
application's source code.


== Using host folder mounting

=== General

Host folder mounting is enabled through the `--tebako-mount` command-line
argument to a Tebako executable as a runtime option.

Syntax:

[source,sh]
----
tebako_executable --tebako-mount {app_dir_path}:{host_dir_path} command
----

Where,

* `tebako_executable` is the path to the Tebako executable.
* `host_dir_path` is the path to the host directory to be mounted.
* `app_dir_path` is the path within the Tebako application's filesystem where
the
  host directory should be mounted.

The option allows you to specify which directories on your host machine should
be mounted into the Tebako memfs during application startup. This can be
done as many times as necessary, allowing you to mount multiple folders or
files.

A HFM-mounted folder is accessible within the packaged application's filesystem
at runtime, allowing the application to read from and write to the mounted
directory as if it were part of the application's filesystem.

Specifically:

* Multiple host folders can be mounted into the application's filesystem by
specifying the `--tebako-mount` option multiple times.

* Mounting individual files is also supported by the `--tebako-mount` option.

* Overlays are supported, meaning that the mounted directory will take
precedence over the packaged application's filesystem if there are conflicting
paths.

Any application packaged with Tebako can benefit from the ability to mount host
directories, opening up possibilities for more complex applications that require
runtime file access.

NOTE: The host folder mounting feature is not limited to Rails applications.

.Running a Rails on Tebako application with host folder mounting
[example]
====
This command mounts the host's `tmp` directory into the Rails
application's filesystem, allowing Rails to write temporary files as
expected.

[source,sh]
----
$ rails.tebako --tebako-mount tmp:$PWD/tmp server
----
====

=== Mounting multiple folders

Tebako's host folder mounting feature allows you to mount multiple host folders
into the application's filesystem.

To mount multiple folders, you can specify the `--tebako-mount` option multiple
times with different host and application paths.

Syntax:

[source,sh]
----
tebako_executable \
  --tebako-mount {app_dir_path_1}:{host_dir_path_1} \
  --tebako-mount {app_dir_path_2}:{host_dir_path_2} \
  command
----

.Running a Rails on Tebako application with multiple host folder mounts
[example]
====
This command mounts the host's `tmp` and `log` directories into the Rails
application's filesystem, allowing Rails to write temporary files and logs as
expected.

[source,sh]
----
$ rails.tebako --tebako-mount tmp:$PWD/tmp --tebako-mount log:$PWD/log server
----
====


=== Mounting individual files

In addition to mounting directories, Tebako's host folder mounting feature
supports mounting individual files into the application's filesystem.

This is useful for selectively overriding specific files within the packaged
application with files from the host system. A Unix socket file or a database
configuration file are examples of files that can be mounted individually.

Syntax:

[source,sh]
----
tebako_executable --tebako-mount {host_file_path}:{app_file_path} command
----

.Running a Rack app on Tebako application with a mounted socket file
[example]
====
This command mounts the host's `socket` file into the Rack application's
filesystem, allowing Rack to use the socket file as expected.

[source,sh]
----
$ rack_app.tebako --tebako-mount my_app.socket:/var/www/myapp/my_app.socket server
----
====


=== Overlaying writable directories

A significant benefit of host folder mounting in Tebako is the ability to
overlay writable directories onto the packaged application's filesystem.

This means that a memfs image is no longer strictly read-only given that the
host folder mounting feature allows writable directories to be mounted into the
application's filesystem.

The syntax is the same as mounting a directory, but the host directory should be
writable by the application.


== Testing out host folder mounting with RoRoT

Let's walk through an example of packaging and running a Rails application with
Tebako.

Here's a simple Rails application structure:

[source]
----
my_rails_app/
├── app/
├── config/
├── db/
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
└── config.ru
----

To package this application with Tebako, you would use a command like this:

[source,sh]
----
$ tebako package -n my_rails_app.teb -e config.ru -r 3.2.0 .
----

This command packages the application using Ruby 3.2.0.

The resulting executable can be run like this with host folder mounting enabled:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./my_rails_app.teb --tebako-mount tmp:$PWD/tmp --tebako-mount log:$PWD/log server
----

This command overlays the writable `tmp` folder from your host system and the
`log` folder, ensuring that Rails can operate with its expected paths for
temporary files, caches, and sockets -- even when packaged within Tebako.


== Conclusion

The introduction of host folder mounting in Tebako 0.9.0 represents a
significant improvement for developers working with complex frameworks like Ruby
on Rails.

By allowing seamless integration of writable directories into the application's
filesystem, this feature opens up new possibilities for packaging Rails
applications in a way that previously wasn't possible.

We're excited to see how the community will leverage these new capabilities,
paving the way for more complex Ruby applications to benefit from Tebako.
