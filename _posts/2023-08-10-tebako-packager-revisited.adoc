    The distribution of Ruby applications can be considered an unsolved problem.
    By itself, Ruby does not provide a consistent and easy method for setting up

= Tebako packager revisited

Tebako is an executable packager. It packages a https://www.ruby-lang.org/[Ruby]
solution with the key idea:

[quote]
____
one Ruby application => one Tebako image
____

Every image contains all the files the application needs to run and has no
dependencies other than what is included in the targeted operating system.

In fact, the Tebako algorithm is very simple.
To create an executable package, Tebako executes five tasks:

. Create an access layer for DwarFS file system with minimal dependencies on
external libraries.

. Build target version of Ruby with minimal dependencies on external libraries.

. Deploy a Ruby solution with all dependencies on the filesystem image.

. Patch Ruby so that it transparently uses the in-memory DwarFS image.

. Combine all together in a single executable.

The main complexity is related to the fulfillment of the
"_with minimal dependencies_" condition for different operating systems.

Although GNU Linux (systems that use the https://sourceware.org/glibc/[GNU C Library `glibc`]),
musl Linux (systems that use https://musl.libc.org[musl libc]),
and macOS (which is BSD based) provide very similar sets of
libraries, their names, dependencies, and packaging differ, and not always in a
predictable and stable way.

Moreover, "_with minimal dependencies_" implies the use of static libraries,
which is contrary to the current trend of preferring shared, dynamic libraries.
For some packages, distributions only provide shared libraries, which means that
the static version of the libraries need to be installed separately or from
source.


These functions are split across five Tebako components and sub-components:

[cols="a,a,3a",options="header"]
|===
| Component	| Sub-component | Functions

.4+| https://rubygems.org/gems/tebako[tebako gem]

| CLI
|
* Processes command-line parameters

| Packager
|
* Patches Ruby (task 4, partially)

| CMake Setup script
|
. Builds static versions of dependencies if missing (task 1)
. Builds Ruby and Dwarfs access layer with minimal external dependencies (task 2)

| CMake Press script
|
. Deploys a Ruby solution with all dependencies on the filesystem image (task 3)
. Builds final executable (task 5)

| https://rubygems.org/gems/tebako-runtime[tebako-runtime gem]
|
|
* Implements runtime adapters (decorators) for certain known Ruby gems that
require modification when running in Tebako environment (task 4, partially)

|===

The description above shows that two copies of Ruby are used when creating the
Tebako image:

* The host Ruby that must be pre-installed to run the Tebako gem.

* The target Ruby that Tebako loads sources for, patches, builds and transforms
to Tebako image.

Version requirements for host Ruby are minimal. Tebako shall run on all 2.7 and
3.x versions.

In contrast, requirements for target Ruby are strict. Tebako 0.5.4 supports
packaging of 2.7.7; 3.0.6; 3.1.4 and 3.2.2.

As mentioned above, the most complex Tebako tasks (tasks 1,2) are implemented by
the setup subcomponent. As a prerequisite, they require the installation of
distribution packages, which may be different for GNU Linux, musl Linux, and
MacOS.  Setup is a lengthy task that can take significant time, up to 2 hours.

The good news is that setup task only needs to be done once and it does not
depend on solution being packaged.

Tebako offers an explicit `tebako setup` command or executes setup implicitly on
the first attempt to create Tebako image.

Once setup has been completed, packaging of any bundle, gem, or simple Ruby
script requires no additional configuration or preparation and can be done with
a single `tebako press` command, which takes several minutes even for large
packages.

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize once again that the most difficult task
solved by Tebako is building a Ruby interpreter and an access layer for an
in-memory file system with minimal dependencies on external libraries. This task
is performed once, after which Tebako provides a one-line command to package any
arbitrary complex Ruby application.
